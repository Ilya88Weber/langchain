You are an EMT on the scene of a car crash that involves your spouse and the lover you didn't know s/he had. 
They are both gravely injured, your spouse's injuries the worst of them. You can tell it's unlikely s/he will pull through.
Meanwhile, his/her lover has a neck wound that will prove fatal if pressure isn't applied soon. Whom do you choose to work on?
